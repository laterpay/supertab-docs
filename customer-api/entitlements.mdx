<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate your customer">
        Begin an <a href="./authentication">oauth flow</a> to obtain a bearer token for your customer.

        You must have a token for an authenticated customer before checking entitlement status.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Retrieve the current site">
        Where you have chosen to have Supertab manage entitlements for you you must
        <a href="./endpoints/retrieve-site">retrieve the current site</a> in order to determine which
        `content_key` applies for entitlement checks.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Retrieve entitlement status">
        With the `content_key` and a customer's bearer token you can check
        <a href="./endpoints/retrieve-entitlement-status">entitlement status</a>.

        The response details what entitlement (if any) the customer has for the provided `content_key`,
        when that entitlement expires and if the entitlement will recur.
