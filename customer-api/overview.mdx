<Note>
    The Customer API and its documentation are currently in development and will be fully available later in Q2 2025.
</Note>

With the Supertab Customer API you can create custom on-page experiences for your customers. You can, for example:

- Implement custom gating of content or services using entitlements
- Create custom purchase flows either for pre-configured, or ad-hoc ("One Time") offerings.

There are two ways to interact with the Customer API:

- **Supertab.js (recommended)**: [Supertab.js](/supertab-js) handles authentication for you and also provides a convenient JavaScript API for interacting with the Customer API.
- **Directly**: Using the Customer API directly in your own code. You can choose whether to authenticate using Supertab.JS (recommended) or with your own code.

The Customer API is designed to be used in the browser on your website and on behalf of your customers. It works seamlessly with the [Merchant API](/merchant-api), which is for server-to-server use cases.
