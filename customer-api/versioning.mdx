The Customer API uses header based versioning.

### Version Header

You should pass the `x-api-version` header with every request.

New API versions are released regularly, each version is supported for 18 months.

If the `x-api-version` header is not provided you will by default be served the latest API version and could
experience breaking changes.

The current latest version is `2025-04-01`. This is the first version of the Customer API.
