In this 3 minute tutorial, we’ll walk you through selling a PDF for 25¢. To do this, you’ll just need to configure your purchase button in our business portal, and then insert your Add to Tab button on your site. Before you start, make sure you’ve already set up an account (4 min). 

Conceptually it’s important to remember how simple this is: **a user will make payment through Supertab, and then once payment is confirmed, your site will execute any command you want** - in this example, it will reveal a link to view or download a PDF. 

## First up, let’s configure your button 
1. Go to the business portal. 
2. Go to the Sites menu item to specify the site that you’ll be deploying your button to. 
    a. Hit the Add Site button 
    b. Enter in a Site Name; this will be used in several places so make sure it properly reflects your site or business name 
    c. Enter in the Site URL, or base level domain name, with http:// or https://. This does not need to be the exact url or page where your code will be hosted. 
3. Now go to the Monetization menu item 
    a. Hit the Single Item toggle 
    b. Hit the Add Single Item button 
    c. From the Site dropdown menu make sure the site you created in step 2 is selected 
Add a description of what you’re selling: let’s call it Pizza Recipe PDF.  
Enter in 0.25 for the price and hit the Save button 
On Save, Your item will appear in the list view 
Now go to the Revenue Generator menu item 
Hit the Purchase Button toggle 
From the Site dropdown menu make sure the site you created in step 2 is selected 
From the Offering dropdown menu, select the offering you created in step 3  
In the Merchant Logo field, paste in the URL of a logo image that will appear in your purchase dialog screen. A logo with dimensions of 125px wide by 75px tall is recommended. 
From the Code Snippet section, hit the Copy button
