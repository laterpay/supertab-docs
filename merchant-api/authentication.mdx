### Scopes

The Merchant API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/merchant-api/endpoints) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

[Supertab.js](/supertab-js) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
