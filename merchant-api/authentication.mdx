### Clients

Before making a request to the Merchant API, you must generate your OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret in the Business Portal.

1. Log in to the [Business Portal](https://business.supertab.co).
2. Click on the **API Keys** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the **Create API Key** button.
4. Enter a name for your API key and click **Save**.
5. Copy the **Client Secret** value from the **Your Secret** modal and store it securely. You will not be able to view this value again.
6. Copy the **Client Secret** value and store it securely. You will not be able to view this value again. Click to close the modal containing the secret.
7. Copy the **Client ID** value from the list of API Keys corresponding to the key you just created. You will need this value to authenticate your requests.

You **must** pass an `x-supertab-client-id` header containing your client id with every request.

### Scopes

The Merchant API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/merchant-api/endpoints) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

[Supertab.js](/supertab-js) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
