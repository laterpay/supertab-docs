### Clients

TBD

You **must** pass an `x-supertab-client-id` header with every request containing your client id.


### API Settings

| | |
|--|--|
| Base URL | `https://mapi.supertab.co/` |
| Supported Grants | `Client Credentials` |
| Authentication URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/auth` |
| Token URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/token` |
| Token Type | `???` |


### Scopes

The Merchant API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/merchant-api/endpoints) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

[Supertab JS](/dead) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
