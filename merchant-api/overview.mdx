With the Supertab Merchant API you can create and retrieve One-Time Offerings, which are ad-hoc offerings to that your users can then purchase via the [Customer API](./customer-api).

In addition to the REST API, there is also a webhook interface for receiving notifications about events that occur in the Supertab platform.

The Merchant API is a server-to-server API designed to be used by your backend. It works seamlessly with the [Customer API](./customer-api), which is for browser-based use cases where you are acting on behalf of your customers.
