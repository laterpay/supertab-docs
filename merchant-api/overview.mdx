<Note>
    The Merchant API and its documentation are currently in development and will be fully available later in Q2 2025.
</Note>

With the Supertab Merchant API you can create and retrieve One-Time Offerings, which are ad-hoc offerings to that your users can then purchase via the [Customer API](./customer-api).

In addition to the REST API, there is also a webhook interface for receiving notifications about events that occur in the Supertab platform.

The Merchant API is a server-to-server API,  means that it is designed to be used in your backend code. It is designed to work seamlessly with the [Customer API](./customer-api), which is for browser-based use cases where you are acting on behalf of your customers.
