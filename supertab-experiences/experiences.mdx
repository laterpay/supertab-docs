## Paywall

<Tip>
  The Paywall experience is best when you want a simple integration where Supertab manages access for you
</Tip>

Paywall display your site's time pass and subscription offerings to customers. The experience will launch automatically on page load and block access to your content until the customer makes a purchase or logs in to use an existing entitlement.

The Paywall is simple, yet adaptable:

- The layout will react to the number of Offerings you select
- A second screen can be added for more customization
- Upsells give you an option to encourage customers to choose other (e.g. longer) offerings. If we detect savings for the user, we will show a calculated discount.
- To align with your brand, colors can be customized and the logo will be displayed at the top of the Paywall (if you added it to the Site)
- Parts of the Paywall text can be edited in all languages we support.

### **Paywall Installation**

**Prerequisite:** you need to create your sites and offerings before setting up a Paywall.

We automatically create the first Paywall for each new site using default time passes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Experience">
    Head to **Experiences** section of the Business Portal and click the **Create Experience** button to go to the Experience Editor.

    If you intend to use the automatically generated Paywall, click the **Edit** button next to it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paywall Setup">
    From the Site dropdown, choose the Site where the Paywall should appear. Select **Paywall** as the Experience type.

    Paywall Redirect URL determines where we will redirect customers if they see the Paywall and close it. We automatically set it to your site URL but it can redirect anywhere (e.g. to a dedicated page).

    **Save** to continue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Offerings">
    In the **Offerings** section, you can choose 1 to 3 Offerings for the main screen. If you enable the **"More options" screen**, you will get three more Offering slots.

    Use the Offering dropdowns to select what to sell and determine the order of Offerings. The preview is interactive and will show changes as you go.

    You cannot use the same Offering on a screen twice.

    For each Offering, you can choose an upsell. We will calculate the difference between prices and if we detect a discount, it will be displayed on the Paywall. Upsells are only displayed when customer clicks on the associated Offering.

    If we detect no discount, the Paywall will adapt to not show the savings badge.

    There are no restrictions for upsells other than the Offering and the associated upsell cannot be the same (e.g. all your time passes can upsell to the same subscription)

    If you choose two or three Offerings on one screen, you will have an option to select which one of them should be highlighted by default to grab the attention of customers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize colors and text">
    Use **Button text color** to edit the **Put it on my Tab** and **More access options** button text.

    **Button color** controls the background of the **Put it on my Tab** button, highlighted Offering box, and the upsell box when active.

    **Highlighted text color** controls the color of text on highlighted Offerings and the savings badge on upsells to ensure proper contrast.

    Parts of Paywall text (such as title) can be edited in all languages we support. They will not be translated automatically. If you choose not to provide a translation, we will use default values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the code snippet">
    Copy the provided code snippet and deploy it on pages you wish to monetize. Make sure to switch the snippet from [Test Mode](https://docs.supertab.co/supertab-experiences/test-mode) to Live Mode if you wish to process real transactions.

    The experience will automatically launch when the page loads. Supertab manages customer access for you.

    The Paywall will automatically update when you edit it, there is no need to update the snippet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Purchase Button

The button to push quality journalism

<Tip>
  The Purchase Button experience is best when you need more control over how and when your customer is offered the option
  to make a purchase
</Tip>

Purchase Buttons display a Supertab purchase button and send a message back to your website when a customer makes a purchase.
