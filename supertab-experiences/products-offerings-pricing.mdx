## Inventory Structure

### Websites

Your <a href="./sites">Websites</a> control what access or entitlement a customer is purchasing.

### Offerings

Offerings detail how you will sell access to your Website.
You can sell access on a time pass, subscription, or single item (one-off basis).

#### Time passes

Time passes grant access to your Website for a fixed period of time.

When you create a new Website, we automatically generate several time passes for you.
You are free to change their duration or pricing.

The minimum time pass duration is 1 second.

#### Subscriptions

Subscriptions grant access to your Website for a fixed period of time, and automatically recur in line with the access period to ensure ongoing access to your website.

Minimum subscription duration is 1 day.

#### Single Item

Single item offerings can be used to sell on a one-off basis to your customers.
**Supertab does not manage access or entitlements for single item offerings.**

Single item offerings are useful if you wish to integrate Supertab Experiences with an existing entitlement management system.

### Pricing

Each offering can be priced individually in each currency your account supports.

Supertab uses the US Dollar as our main currency and will automatically suggest pricing in other currencies based on an average exchange rate.

## Configure your Offerings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Website">
    Before configuring offerings you must first create a <a href="./sites">Website</a> to hold your inventory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new offerings or edit defaults">
    When you create a Website, Supertab automatically creates three default time pass offerings for you, with durations of 24 hours, 3 days and 1 week, and accompanying default pricing.

    Head to the Offerings section to create new time passes, subscriptions or single items. Specify prices in dollars, and choose duration for time passes and subscriptions.&#x20;
