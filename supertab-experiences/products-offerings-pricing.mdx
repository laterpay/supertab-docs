## Inventory Structure

### Sites

Your <a href="./sites">Sites</a> control what access or entitlement a customer is purchasing.

### Offerings

Offerings detail how you will sell access to your site.
You can sell access on a timepass, subscription, or one-off basis.

#### Timepasses

Timepasses grant access to your site for a fixed period of time.

When you create a new Site we automatically generate several timepasses for you.
You are free to change their duration or pricing.

#### Subscriptions

Subscriptions grant access to your site for a fixed period of time, and automatically recur in line with the access period
to ensure ongoing access to your site.

Subscriptions can be enabled for any timepass with a duration of 4 weeks or longer.

#### Single Item

Single item offerings can be used to sell on a one-off basis to your customers.
Supertab does not manage access or entitlements for single item offerings.

Single item offerings are useful if you wish to integrate Supertab Experiences with an existing entitlement management system

### Pricing

Each offering can be priced individually in each currency your account supports.

Supertab uses the US Dollar as our main currency and will automatically suggest pricing in other currencies based on
an average exchange rate.

## Configure your Offerings

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a site">
        Before configuring offerings you must first create a <a href="./sites">site</a> to hold your inventory.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Edit the default offerings">
        When you create a site Supertab automatically creates three default timepass offerings for you,
        with durations of 24 hours, 3 days and 1 week, and accompanying default pricing.

        You are free to change these durations and prices as you see fit.
    </Step>

    <Step title="(Optional) Enable subscriptions">
        If you wish to sell a subscription offering you can enable the subscription option on on eof your timepasses,
        as long as the timepass has a duration of 4 weeks or more.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up experiences">
        Continue by setting up your <a href="./experiences">experiences</a> to begin selling.
