Supertab organises your inventory into Websites. A Website is an online property where you use Supertab. It can be a site, blog, or SaaS product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register for a Merchant Account">
    Register your <a href="/supertab-introduction/account-management/account-kyc">merchant account</a> and complete onboarding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first Website">
    Use the <a href="https://business.supertab.co/">Business Portal</a> to create a Website.

    You must provide a customer facing name for the Website and its root URL, including protocol.

    It's important to get the URL correct as Supertab uses this to make sure customers are logged in securely when interacting with your Website.

    The root URL should be the domain or subdomain of the website you intend to serve Supertab experiences from; for example `https://mypublication.com`, `https://blog.mywebsite.com`.

    You can change the name or URL associated with your Website at any time.



    Contact support if you need to serve the same experience from multiple domains or subdomains.
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Add a logo">
    You can add a logo for each of your Websites. We will automatically use it in some Experiences (e.g. Paywall) and in the purchase flow to better align with your brand.

    We accept SVG or PNG files with max size of 512x512px.
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Make a note of your client details">
    We generate a live and <a href="./test-mode">test</a> API client for each Website.

    You will need their IDs if you wish to swap between test and live mode.

    Supertab includes the correct client ID in the code snipped generated from the
    <a href="./experiences">experience editor</a>.
