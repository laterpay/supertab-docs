Supertab organises your inventory into Sites. A Site could be your publication, blog or SaaS product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register for a Merchant Account">
    Register your <a href="/supertab-introduction/account-management/account-kyc">merchant account</a> and complete onboarding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first site">
    Use the <a href="https://business.supertab.co/">Business Portal</a> to create a Site.

    You must provide a customer facing name for the Site and its root URL, including protocol.

    It's important to get the URL correct as Supertab uses this to make sure customers are logged in securely
    when interacting with your site.

    The root URL should be the domain or subdomain of the website you intend to serve Supertab experiences from;
    for example `https://mypublication.com`, `https://blog.mywebsite.com`.

    You can change the name or URL associated with your site at any time.

    Contact support if you need to serve the same experience from multiple domains or subdomains.
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Make a note of your client details">
    We generate a live and <a href="./test-mode">test</a> API client for each site.

    You will need their IDs if you wish to swap between test and live mode.

    Supertab includes the correct client ID in the code snipped generated from the
    <a href="./experiences">experience editor</a>.
