Test Mode allows developers to test <a href="/supertab-experiences/experiences">Supertab Experiences</a> without processing real transactions.
Using test cards, developers can simulate payment scenarios and toggle between Test and Live modes through the Experience Editor.&#x20;

Identity verification (KYC) and providing financial information for payouts can be deferred until youâ€™re ready to go live. You can create Sites, Offerings, and Experiences without completing this step; however, it must be finalized before enabling Live Mode and accepting payments.

## Key Features

* Test mode replicates Live Mode behavior, except no real transactions occur. This allows comprehensive testing of all APIs and integration flows.

* Each <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> generates a Test Client and a Live Client. The Experience Editor automatically uses the correct ID based on the selected mode.

* The Installation tab in the Experience Editor allow toggling between modes and provides ready-to-use code snippets, eliminating the need for manual ID swapping.

## Creating and Editing Experiences

* To create or edit an Experience, go to the Experiences section of the Business Portal. Here, you'll find a list of existing Experiences and the option to add a new one.

* When adding a new Experience or editing an existing one, you will be taken to the Experience Editor.

* In the Installation tab of the Experience Editor, there is an option to toggle between Test Mode and Live Mode.

  * Switching modes automatically updates the installation code provided, so developers can simply copy the correct snippet without changing client IDs manually.

  * The code must be installed on all pages where the Experience is intended to be displayed.

## Using Stripe Test Cards

Use Stripe test cards to simulate various scenarios. Common test cards include:

* Successful Payment: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Visa)

* Card Declined: `4000 0000 0000 0002`

* Insufficient Funds: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

* Incorrect CVC: `4000 0000 0000 0127`

* Expired Card: `4000 0000 0000 0069`

* 3D Secure Required: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

## Steps to Simulate a Test Transaction:

1. Install the Test Mode code snippet on all relevant pages.

2. Visit the page displaying the Test Mode Experience.

3. Keep adding Offerings to your Tab until you fill it up.

4. Proceed to payment, and enter a Stripe test card.

5. Complete the form and confirm the transaction. The system will simulate the payment and return the result.

## Post-Transaction Testing and Monitoring

* Use direct API calls to see test tabs, purchases, and payments.

* To see test transactions as an end user, log in to [my.supertab.co](https://my.supertab.co/) with appropriate login credentials and add `?testmode=true` at the end of the URL.

## Moving to Production

1. Once testing is complete, follow these steps to move your Experiences and integrations to production:

2. Switch to Live Mode in the Experience Editor and complete KYC if required.

3. Install the Live Mode code snippet on relevant pages.

4. Use real cards for live transactions.

5. Monitor live transactions in the Dashboard to ensure they process correctly.
