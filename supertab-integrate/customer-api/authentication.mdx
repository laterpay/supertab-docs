---

All requests to the Customer API require authentication with a bearer token unless stated otherwise.

Supertab uses OAuth2 to issue JWT tokens which allow you take actions such as purchasing on behalf of your customer
from within the browser.

You should not implement OAuth2 yourself, instead use an [existing library](https://oauth.net/code/) or make use of the
[browser-sdk](/) to obtain tokens.

----

### Clients

Before making a request to the Customer API you must generate an OAuth client.

This is done for you when you create a [site](/supertab-experiences/sites).
Each site will have an associated live and [test](/supertab-experiences/test-mode) client.

The current client is used by the Customer API to determine the [context](./clients) your integration is running in.

### Scopes

The Customer API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/api-reference) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

The [browser-sdk](/) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
