---

All requests to the Customer API require authentication with a bearer token unless stated otherwise.

Supertab uses OAuth2 to issue JWT tokens which allow you take actions such as purchasing on behalf of your customer
from within the browser.

You should not implement OAuth2 yourself, instead use an [existing library](https://oauth.net/code/) or make use of the
[browser-sdk](/) to obtain tokens.

### Clients

Before making a request to the Customer API you must generate an OAuth client.

This is done for you when you create a [site](/supertab-experiences/sites).
Each site will have an associated live and [test](/supertab-experiences/test-mode) client.

The current client is used by the Customer API to determine the [context](./clients) your integration is running in.

### API Settings

import SdkWarning from '/snippets/sdk-warning.mdx';

<SdkWarning />

| | |
|--|--|
| Base URL | `https://tapi.supertab.co/customer/` |
| Supported Grants | `Authorization Code + PKCE`, `Refresh Token` |
| Authentication URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/auth` |
| Token URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/token` |
| Token Type | `bearer` |

### Redirect URIs

In order to successfully authenticate using oAuth2 you must pass a known redirect URI to the Authentication URL.
You can configure your site's redirect URIs from the [Business Portal](https://business.supertab.co).

In order to support enhanced UX you may also authenticate your customer in a pop up.

To do so, open a popup to the authentication URL with your redirect uri set to
`https://signon.supertab.co/oauth/auth-proxy?origin={your-site-url}` where `{your-site-url}` is the
one the redirect URIs you set when creating the site.

You must open the popup from the same domain as your redirect URI.

This page will communicate back to your website via an opener message upon successful authentication.
We recommend you use the Browser SDK to handle all authentication, which takes care of this for you.

### Scopes

The Customer API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/api-reference) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

The [browser-sdk](/) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
