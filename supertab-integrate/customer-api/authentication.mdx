All requests to the Customer API require authentication with a bearer token unless stated otherwise.

Supertab uses OAuth2 to issue JWT tokens which allow you take actions such as purchasing on behalf of your customer
from within the browser.

You should not implement OAuth2 yourself, instead use an [existing library](https://oauth.net/code/) or make use of the
[Supertab JS](/dead) to obtain tokens.

To make authenticated calls pass the token acquired from the Token URL in the `Authorization` header.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Supertab JS
    supertab = new Supertab(new Config(clientId))

    // Supertab JS launches the authentication flow in a pop up
    // and stores the resulting token in local storage
    supertab.authenticate()
    ```

    ```bash curl
    curl --location 'https://capi.supertab.co/customers/me' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ••••••' \
    --header 'X-Supertab-Client-ID: ••••••'
    ```

    ```javascript javascript
    fetch('https://capi.supertab.co/customers/me', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ******',
        'X-Supertab-Client-ID': '******',
        }
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Clients

Before making a request to the Customer API you must generate an OAuth client.

<Warning>
    Make sure to use the client detail generated for your site when working with the Customer API.

    The API Keys generated separately in the Business Portal are for use with the [Merchant API](/dead).
</Warning>

This is done for you automatically when you create a [site](/supertab-experiences/sites).
Each site will have an associated live and [test](/supertab-experiences/test-mode) client.

The current client is used by the Customer API to determine the [context](./clients) your integration is running in.

You **must** pass a `X-Supertab-Client-ID` header with every request containing your client id.

### API Settings

<SdkWarning />

| | |
|--|--|
| Base URL | `https://tapi.supertab.co/customer/` |
| Supported Grants | `Authorization Code + PKCE`, `Refresh Token` |
| Authentication URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/auth` |
| Token URL | `https://auth.supertab.co/oauth2/token` |
| Token Type | `bearer` |

### Redirect URIs

In order to successfully authenticate using oAuth2 you must pass a known redirect URI to the Authentication URL.
You can configure your site's redirect URIs from the [Business Portal](https://business.supertab.co).

In order to support enhanced UX you may also authenticate your customer in a pop up.

To do so, open a popup to the authentication URL with your redirect uri set to
`https://signon.supertab.co/oauth/auth-proxy?origin={your-site-url}` where `{your-site-url}` is the
one the redirect URIs you set when creating the site.

You must open the popup from the same domain as your redirect URI.

This page will communicate back to your website via an opener message upon successful authentication.
We recommend you use Supertab JS to handle all authentication, which takes care of this for you.

### Scopes

The Customer API is scoped to allow issuing tokens with minimum permissions.

The [api specification](/api-reference) details the required scopes for each operation.
You must request a token with the scopes you require when authenticating the customer.

[Supertab JS](/dead) handles acquiring tokens with the correct scopes for you.
