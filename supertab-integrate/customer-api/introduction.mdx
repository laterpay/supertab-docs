The Customer API can be used to develop integrations with Supertab for websites or products that run primarily in
your customer's browser. It can be used to purchase pre-defined [offerings](/supertab-experiences/products-offerings-pricing)
or [arbitrary micro purchases](/dead).

## Browser SDK

It is best to utilise the Customer API through the Supertab [browser-sdk](/dead).
The underlying API is documented here as reference for what is happening "under the hood" when you utilise the browser-sdk.
All examples include their browser-sdk equivalents.

## Workflow

<Steps>
    <Step title="Discover client context">
        Load information on the current [user and client context](./clients) to discover available offerings,
        your customer's tab limit and currency preferences.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Display offerings to your customer">
        Offer your customer a choice of ways to purchase access to your content, product or digital goods.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make a purchase">
        When your customer has made a choice, place the [purchase on their tab](./purchasing) in order to complete it.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Forward your customer to the payment flow">
        When the customer has filled their tab, it's time to redirect them to the [payment flow](./payments).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check status of customer purchases">
        Use the [Merchant API](/dead) or subscribe to a [webhook](/dead) to get updates about your customer's purchases
        and access status.
    </Step>
