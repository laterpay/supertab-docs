In order to purchase an offering you must first know its id and which currency to purchase the offering in.

There details can be discovered by [retrieving the current client context and user details](./clients).

<Warning>
    We strongly recommend you interact with the Customer API using the [Supertab browser-sdk](/)
    when building integrations with Supertab.

    In general you should always use the browser-sdk to make purchases so that the customer can be properly
    prompted to confirm their purchase intent.

## Make a Purchase

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript browser-sdk (js)
    Example missing
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Request

Purchases are placed on the customer's tab. If the customer does not have an active tab making a purchase will generate one.

<ResponseField name="PurchaseRequest.offering_id" type="string">
    The offering to purchase.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="PurchaseRequest.currency_code" type="string">
    ISO2417 currency code.

    This currency must be supported by your client and offering, and available for the purchase by the customer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="PurchaseRequest.metadata" type="object">
    Freeform metadata field.

    You can attach arbitrary to a purchase, for example to include a user identifier from your system.

    This metadata will be returned to you in purchases responses, or through the [Merchant API](/dead).
</ResponseField>

### Response

<Note>
    This part of the proposed API spec is under-developed
</Note>


<ResponseField name="Purchase.purchase_outcome" type="boolean">
    Purchases that have been successfully placed on the customer's tab have are `completed`.
    Access grants (if any) will process immediately.

    If payment is required following this purchae (when the tab limit has been reached) the purchase is `pending`
    and will transition to `completed` following payment.

    Purchases may be `rejected` if Supertab they have e.g been requested in an unsupported currency.

    <sub>Allowed values: `completed` `pending` `rejected`</sub>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Purchase.payment_required" type="boolean">
    A purchase may require payment to `complete`.

    You should forward the customer to the [payment flow.](./payments)
</ResponseField>

## Making Purchases Without Invoking the Confirmation Flow

It is possible to make a purchase on behalf of your customer without displaying the confirmation flow.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript browser-sdk (js)
    Example missing
    ```
</CodeGroup>

This may be desirable if you're integration expects to make several purchases in response to user actions,
for example a chat bot which charges per message or bundle of messages.

When making purchases without invoking the confirmation flow you must:

- Have explicit user permission to do so (through a control in your UI or similar)
- Give the user the option to disable this behaviour
- Display a message informing the user you have made a purchase on their behalf automatically

See [branding and deployment guidelines](/dead) for more information.
