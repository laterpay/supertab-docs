The Customer API uses header based versioning.

### Version Header

You should pass the `x-api-version` header with every request.
When this header is not provided you will automatically consume the latest version of the API, which could lead to
unexpected behaviour.

New API versions are released regularly, each version is supported for 18 months.

If the `x-api-version` header is not provided you will by default be served the latest API version and could
experience breaking changes.
