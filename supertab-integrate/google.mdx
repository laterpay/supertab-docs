## **What is Google Offerwall?**

**Google Offerwall** helps Merchants explore new monetization opportunities by allowing website visitors to access content through alternative methods, such as watching a short ad or paying a small fee via Supertab.&#x20;

It is part of the **Privacy & Messaging** features of Google Ad Manager. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/11897778).

## **How does Supertab work within Google Offerwall?**

When visitors land on your website, the Offerwall restricts access to your content and presents options to unlock it. If you enable Supertab, one of these options will allow visitors to pay a small fee to access your entire site for a set period of time.

When visitors choose Supertab and select one of the Offerings, they sign up to create a virtual Tab or log in to use an existing one. Their purchases accumulate on their Tabs until they reach the Tab limit, which is when they will be asked to pay the balance.&#x20;
