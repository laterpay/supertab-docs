## Overview

Off-App Purchases let you generate a link that your users can click on to purchase a specific offering from your web or mobile app.

When users click the link, they’re taken to the Supertab Off-App Purchase Page, where they sign in and confirm their purchase. Once complete, Supertab redirects them back to your app with purchase details included in the URL’s query parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before generating a link, make sure you have:

- A configured <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> with a URL or deep link that matches your app’s domain. This will be used as the post-purchase redirect destination.
- An <a href="/supertab-experiences/products-offerings-pricing">Offering</a> available for purchase.

## Creating a Purchase Link

Include the following required query parameters to generate a valid purchase link:

- `client_id` – A live or test client ID associated with the <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> you created.
- `offering_id` – The ID of the <a href="/supertab-experiences/offerings">Offering</a> the user is purchasing.

### Example

```
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering
```

### Metadata

You can optionally include a `metadata` parameter with custom key-value pairs. This metadata:

- Is returned in the `metadata` query parameter during the redirect back to your app.
- Is also attached to the purchase object after confirmation.

**How to encode metadata:**

1. Format it as a URL query string (e.g. `user_id=123&nonce=456`).
2. Encode it using URL component encoding (e.g. `user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456`).

**Example with metadata:**

```
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering&metadata=user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456
```

## Handling the Redirect

After users complete or exit the purchase flow, they’re redirected to your app with the following query parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                       | Example                                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `purchase_id`  | The ID of the purchase. Use it to <a href="/customer-api/endpoints/retrieve-a-purchase">retrieve purchase details</a> via the Customer API. | "purchase.cf637646-71a4-430d-aaea-a66f1a48a83c"        |
| `status`       | The purchase status. Possible values:<ul><li>`completed` – the purchase was successful</li><li>`abandoned` – the user exited before completing</li></ul> | "completed"                                            |
| `offering_id`  | The ID of the selected offering, passed in the original purchase link.                                            | "offering.4df706b5-297a-49c5-a4cd-2a10eca12ff9"        |
| `metadata`     | The custom key-value metadata you included in the original link.                                                  | "user_id=123&nonce=456"                                |
