description: 'Enable seamless purchases through your app with a simple redirect flow.'

## Overview

Off-App Purchases let you generate a URL that your users can use to purchase a specific offering from your web or mobile app.

When opening the Off-App Purchase URL, customers sign up and confirm their purchase with Supertab. After completion,
Supertab redirects the customer back to your app.

## Prerequisites

Before generating a URL, make sure you have:

- A <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> with a URL you wish to use as the post-purchase redirect destination.
- An <a href="/supertab-experiences/products-offerings-pricing">Offering</a> available for purchase.

## Creating a Purchase Link

Include the following required query parameters to generate a valid purchase link:

- `client_id` – A live or test client ID associated with the <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> you created.
- `offering_id` – The ID of the <a href="/supertab-experiences/offerings">Offering</a> the user is purchasing.

```text Purchase URL
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering
```

### Metadata

You can optionally include a `metadata` parameter with custom key-value pairs. This metadata:

- Is returned in the `metadata` query parameter during the redirect back to your app.
- Is also attached to the purchase object after confirmation.

**How to encode metadata:**

1. Format metadata as a URL query string (e.g. `user_id=123&nonce=456`).
2. Then encode using URL component encoding (e.g. `user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456`).

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript js
    const metadata = {
        user_id: "123",
        nonce: "456",
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    const queryString = new URLSearchParams(metadata).toString();
    const encodedMetadata = encodeURIComponent(queryString);

    const purchaseUrl = `https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering&metadata=${encodedMetadata}`;
    ```
</CodeGroup>

**Example with metadata:**

```text Purchase URL with Metadata
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering&metadata=user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456
```

## Handling the Redirect

The customer is redirected to your app when they have completed the purchase flow.
