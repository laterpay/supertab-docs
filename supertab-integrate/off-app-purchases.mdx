## Overview

Off-App Purchases enables merchants to generate a link allowing users to purchase a specific offering through their web or mobile app.

When users follow the link, they're redirected to the Supertab Off-App Purchase Page to sign in and confirm the purchase. Once the flow is complete, they're redirected back to your app with details included in the URL query parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before generating a link, ensure you have:

- Configured <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> with a URL that matches your app's domain. This can be app's deep link URL which will be used as the post-purchase redirect destination.
- Added <a href="/supertab-experiences/products-offerings-pricing">an Offering</a> to purchase.

## Creating a Purchase link

The following query parameters are required to generate a valid purchase link:

- `client_id` – A live or test client ID associated with <a href="/supertab-experiences/sites">Site</a> you created.
- `offering_id` – The ID of the <a href="/supertab-experiences/offerings">Offering</a> to purchase.

### Example

```
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering
```

### Metadata

You may also include an optional `metadata` parameter with key-value pairs of custom information. This metadata will be returned as URL query parameter `metadata` with the redirect back to your app. Metadata is also attached to the purchase object once the customer has confirmed the purchase.

Encoding:

1. Metadata has to be formatted as a URL query string, for example `user_id=123&nonce=456`.
2. Then it has to be URL component encoded, for example `user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456`.

Example purchase link with metadata:

```
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering&metadata=user_id%3D123%26nonce%3D456
```


## Handling the redirect

After the user completes or exits the purchase flow, they're redirected back to your app with the following query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `purchase_id` | The ID of the purchase. It can be used to <a href="/customer-api/endpoints/retrieve-a-purchase">retrieve the purchase details</a> using Customer API. | `"purchase.cf637646-71a4-430d-aaea-a66f1a48a83c"` |
| `status` | The status of the purchase. Possible values:<ul><li>`completed` - purchase was completed</li><li>`abandoned` - user exited the flow without completing the purchase</li></ul> | `"completed"` |
| `offering_id` | The ID of the offering initially selected, i.e. passed in the purchase link. | `"offering.4df706b5-297a-49c5-a4cd-2a10eca12ff9"` |
| `metadata` | Key-value pairs of custom information you included in the purchase link. | `"user_id=123&nonce=456"` |
