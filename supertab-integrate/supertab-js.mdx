This guide documents all available methods of `Supertab` object in browser-side JavaScript package `@getsupertab/supertab-js`.

## Pre-requisites

The following is required to start working with Supertab JS:

1. Supertab business account. <a href="https://business.supertab.co/register">Create one here</a>.
2. Site created in the business portal. <a href="../supertab-experiences/sites">Go to the guide</a>.
3. Client ID for the created site. You can find it in the list of sites on Sites page in the business portal.

## Installation

### Direct script include

Add the following script tag to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://js.supertab.co/v2/bundle.js"></script>
```

This exposes `Supertab` class to the `window` object. You can then instantiate the Supertab client:

```javascript
const SupertabClient = new window.Supertab({
  clientId: "client.test",
});
```

### npm package

```bash
npm install @getsupertab/supertab-browser
```

Then import and instantiate the Supertab client:

```javascript
import Supertab from "@getsupertab/supertab-js";

const SupertabClient = new Supertab({
  clientId: "client.test",
});
```

### Next steps

Once Supertab client is instantiated, it provides various services that you can access through its properties:

- `customer` - for interacting with customer data
- `site` - for accessing site properties
- `purchase` - for handling purchases
- `entitlement` - for checking status of entitlement
- `experience` – for starting experiences

Each service exposes specific methods to help you integrate Supertab functionality into your application.

# Quick Start

Launch paygate experience on current page.

```javascript
import Supertab from "@getsupertab/supertab-js";

const SupertabClient = new Supertab({
  clientId: "client.test",
});

const paygate = await SupertabClient.experience.startExperience({
  experienceId: "experience.test",
});

paygate.show();
```
