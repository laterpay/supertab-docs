Supertab purchase button renders a button in DOM. When clicked, it initiates the purchase flow. Throughout the customer’s journey, various events may occur. Callback functions, defined in the initialization object, are triggered for these events, enabling you to handle them as needed.

To get started with purchase button, first <a href="../supertab-experiences/experiences">set up the experience</a>. Once complete, the code snippet generated in the final step of the Experience Editor will look similar to the following:

```js
<script type="module">
  import { createPurchaseButtonExperience } from "https://js.supertab.co/v1/experiences.js";

  (async () => {
    const { destroy } = await createPurchaseButtonExperience({
      containerElement: document.getElementById("YOUR_ELEMENT_ID"),
      clientId: "live_client.41aa0927-e29f-4572-add8-3c73fa0c0367",
      merchantName: "Your website name",
      merchantLogoUrl: "https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-logo.png",
      offeringId: "offering.77bdfc93-5de0-48da-a9d0-65754e0bb947",
      label: "Put it on my tab",
      onPurchaseCompleted: () => {
        //insert your code to grant user access
        console.log("Purchase completed!");
      },
      onPriorEntitlement: () => {
        //insert your code to handle when prior entitlement is detected
        console.log("User has prior entitlement.");
      },
      onPurchaseCanceled: () => {
        //insert your code to handle when purchase is not completed
        console.log("Purchase canceled!");
      },
      onError: () => {
        //insert your code to handle an unexpected error
        console.log("Purchase error!");
      },
      uiConfig: {
        colors: {
          text: "#9b4c4cff",
          background: "#ffffffff",
        },
      },
    });
  })();
</script>
```

The async function `createPurchaseButtonExperience` returns the object with `destroy` property which can be called to remove purchase button from DOM when interaction with a button is no longer needed.
