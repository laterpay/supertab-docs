For content and service providers, from GenAI to video to publishing, Supertab opens up a new revenue stream by monetizing users who would otherwise never subscribe. We enable users to unlock digital content without subscriptions, upfront payments, or long-term commitments.

## Understand

### Payment Aggregation

Supertab aggregates customer purchases onto a running Tab. Customers can make purchases until their personal Tab limit is reached, at which time they must pay it off. Customers' Tabs are global and shared between all Supertab merchants, making Supertab a convenient payment method used for a variety of digital goods and services across the web.&#x20;

This approach enables Supertab to minimize transaction fees and make processing small transactions more cost-effective.

### Tab Limits

New customers receive Tabs with a limit of up to \$5 (or local equivalent).

### Prices

Supertab can be used to sell any item priced from \$0.01 to \$999.99 or equivalent in 134 other currencies we support.

### Payments

Supertab collects payment from the customer when:

* The customer's Tab exceeds its limit,

* *or* The customer's Tab is inactive

### Payouts

Supertab pays out funds received from customers to you immediately (less our fees)
