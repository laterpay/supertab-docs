Supertab monetizes users who would otherwise never subscribe.
We enable users to unlock digital content without subscriptions, upfront payments, or long-term commitments -
Supertab makes it easy to buy.

We aggregate small charges on a running Tab and only process them when a preset threshold is reached.
This makes processing small transactions more cost-effective.

## The Tab

### Payment Aggregation

Supertab aggregates customer purchases onto a running Tab. Customers can make purchases until reaching their personal
tab limit, at which time they must pay off their tab.
Customers' Tabs are global and shared between all Supertab merchants, making Supertab a convenient payment method used
for a variety of digital goods and services.

### Limits

Supertab can be used to sell any item priced from $0.01 to $10.00.

New customers receive Tabs with a limit of $1, rising to $5 (or local equivalent) after first payment.

### Payments

Supertab collects payment from the customer when:

- The customer's Tab exceeds its ($5) limit
- The customer's Tab has been inactive for 14 days (the customer has not made any purchases for 14 days)

### Payouts

Supertab pays out monies received from customers to you immediately (less our fees)

### Availability

Supertab is available globally, in 135 currencies.
