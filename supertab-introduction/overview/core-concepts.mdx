Supertab is a novel digital payment solution, specifically designed to make small payments possible.
For content and service providers, from GenAI to video to publishing, Supertab opens up a new revenue stream by monetizing users who would otherwise never subscribe. We enable users to unlock digital content without subscriptions, upfront payments, or long-term commitments - in other words, Supertab makes it easy to buy.
We do so by aggregating small charges on a running Tab and only processing them when a preset amount or time threshold is reached. This enables Supertab to minimize transaction fees and make processing small transactions more cost-effective.
We have options that can meet you whenever you are, whether you are looking for no-code, low-code, or custom solutions.

## The Tab

### Payment Aggregation

Supertab aggregates customer purchases onto a running Tab. Customers can make purchases until reaching their personal Tab limit, at which time they must pay off the balance.
Customers' Tabs are global and shared between all Supertab merchants, making Supertab a convenient payment method used for a variety of digital goods and services across the web.

### Limits

Supertab can be used to sell any item priced from $0.01 to $999.99 or equivalent in other currencies.

New users receive Tabs with a limit of $1, rising to $5 (or local equivalent) after first payment.

### Payments

Supertab collects payment from the customer when:

* The user's Tab exceeds its limit,

* The user has not made any purchases for 30 days.

### Payouts

Supertab pays out funds received from customers to you immediately (less our fees)

### Availability

Supertab is available globally, in 135 currencies.
