---

Supertab JS provides a low-code way to start experiences on your pages. See [Set up Experiences](/supertab-experiences/experiences) guide for more details on how to create and configure experiences.

While adding an experience to your site is as simple as copy-pasting a code snippet from the Business Portal, each experience comes with a set of callback functions for handling various experience outcomes. These callbacks allow you to execute custom code in response to specific events such as purchase status, entitlements statuses, or error conditions.

All experiences share the same on-page API, making the initialization config for all types of experiences almost identical.

## Pre-requisites

- You have <a href="/supertab-experiences/experiences">created an experience</a> in the business portal.
- Supertab JS is <a href="/supertab-js/installation">installed on your page</a>.
