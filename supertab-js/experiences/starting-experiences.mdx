Supertab.js provides a low-code way to start experiences on your pages.
See [the guide on setting up experiences](/supertab-experiences/experiences)
for more details on how to create and configure experiences.

When you need more control over what happens with experiences you can use Supertab.js to recieve callbacks
for specific events, entitlement statuses, or error conditions.

## Pre-requisites

- You have <a href="/supertab-experiences/experiences">created an experience</a> in the business portal.

## Initialization

```javascript
const supertabClient = new Supertab({clientId: "client.your_client"});
```

## Paywall: `supertab.createPaywall`

Invoke the Paywall on page load or in response to user action.

```javascript
const supertabClient = new Supertab({ clientId: "test_client.abc" });

const supertabPaywall = await supertabClient.createPaywall({
  experienceId: "experience.abc",
});

supertabPaywall.show()
```
