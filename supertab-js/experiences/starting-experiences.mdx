Supertab.js provides a low-code way to start experiences on your pages.
See [the guide on setting up experiences](/supertab-experiences/experiences)
for more details on how to create and configure experiences.

When you need more control over what happens with experiences you can use Supertab.js to recieve callbacks
for specific events, entitlement statuses, or error conditions.

## Pre-requisites

    ```

    ```javascript Installed via CDN

    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Paygate: `supertab.createPaygate`
