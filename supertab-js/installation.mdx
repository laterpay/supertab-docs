Supertab JS is published as an npm package and as a compiled bundle hosted on our CDN.

The constructor of `Supertab` class expects an object containing a `clientId` property. This is the client ID of the site you have created in the <a href="https://business.supertab.co">Business Portal</a>. See [Create Sites](/supertab-experiences/sites) guide.

## npm

```bash
npm install @getsupertab/supertab-js@3.0.0
```

Then import `Supertab` class and instantiate it:

```javascript
import { Supertab } from "@getsupertab/supertab-js";

const supertabClient = new Supertab({ clientId: "test_client.X" });
```

## CDN

The compiled bundle exposes `Supertab` class to `window` object.

```javascript
<script src="https://js.supertab.co/v3/supertab.js"></script>
<script>
  const supertabClient = new window.Supertab({ clientId: "test_client.X" });
</script>
```
