Before [launching an experience](/supertab-js/experiences/starting-experiences)
you must first install and initialize Supertab.js

You must have a Supertab `clientId` to use Supertab.js.
You can find the `clientId` associated with each of your sites in the [business portal](/supertab-experiences/sites).

## with npm

```bash Install
npm install @getsupertab/supertab-js
```

Then import `Supertab` class and instantiate it:

```javascript Initialize
import { Supertab } from "@getsupertab/supertab-js";

const supertabClient = new Supertab({ clientId: "test_client.X" });
```

## with CDN

The compiled module exports `Supertab` class.

```javascript Include & Initialize
<script type="module">
import { Supertab } from "https://js.supertab.co/v3/sdk.js"

const supertabClient = new Supertab({ clientId: "test_client.X" });
</script>
```

### Versioning

The CDN URL is versioned, including `v3` will automatically upgrade you to new *minor* versions.
Breaking changes are included in new *major* versions.
