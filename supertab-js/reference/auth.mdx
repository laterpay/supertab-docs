`Supertab.auth` is an entry point for authenticating a user. It abstracts the authentication flow and auth state management, allowing your application to easily implement login functionality and make authenticated requests to the Customer API.

Once a user is authenticated, the necessary authorization headers are passed to each Customer API request dispatched via <a href="/supertab-js/reference/api">Supertab.api</a>.

<Info>
  `Supertab.auth` handles the event of token expiration and refreshes the token
  before attempting to make an authenticated call to the Customer API. There is no need to re-authenticate a user manually.
</Info>

## Properties

### `session`

This property returns the user's session data. `null` if the user is not authenticated. See [AuthData](#authdata) for the type definition.

#### Example

```typescript
const session = await supertabClient.auth.session;
```

### `status`

This property returns the authentication status of the user. The possible values are:

* `missing` - The user is not authenticated.
* `expired` - The user's session has expired and needs to be refreshed before making an authenticated request to the Customer API. See [start](#start) method for more details on how to refresh the session.
* `valid` - The user is authenticated.

#### Example
```typescript
const status = await supertabClient.auth.status;
```

## Methods

### `start`

This method initiates the authentication process when necessary and returns the user's session data.

Based on the presence of session data:

- If session already exists, it returns auth data from the browser storage.
- If session has expired, it refreshes the token.
- If session is missing, it opens Supertab SSO in a popup window allowing users to sign up for an account or log in to the existing account.

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="silently" type="boolean" default="false">
  When set to `true`, the client does not open the Supertab SSO popup and
  instead attempts to refresh the session in the background. Refresh can only succeed if there is an expired session in the browser storage. This will make the method return `null` for unknown users with no prior session.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="screenHint" type="string" default="register">
  Specifies which screen to display in the Supertab SSO popup. Valid options are
  `register` and `login`.
</ParamField>

#### Returns

A promise which resolves with the user's session data object. See [AuthData](#authdata) for the type definition.

<ResponseField name="accessToken" type="string">
  The access token used for making authenticated requests to the Customer API.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="refreshToken" type="string">
  The token used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expiresAt" type="Date">
  The date and time when the access token will expire.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tokenType" type="string" default="Bearer">
  The type of authentication token, typically "Bearer".
</ResponseField>

#### Examples

```typescript Authenticate user
// Will open the Supertab SSO popup if there is
// no session data.
await supertabClient.auth.start();
```

```typescript Authenticate user silently
// Attempt to get session data or refresh session if
// expired. It will not open the Supertab SSO popup and
// will return `null` if the user is unknown.
await supertabClient.auth.start({ silently: true });
```

```typescript Authenticate user with screen hint
// Send user to the login screen in Supertab SSO.
await supertabClient.auth.start({ screenHint: "login" });
```

### `reset`

This method resets the authentication state by clearing the browser storage.
