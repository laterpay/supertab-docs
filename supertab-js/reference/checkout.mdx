`Supertab.checkout` client handles the checkout flow for purchases requiring payment.


## Methods

### `start`

This method starts the checkout process. Whenever the purchase requires payment (i.e. the tab reaches the limit or the purchased offering is of a "pay now" type), use this method to start the checkout flow and allow user to pay for the tab.

The payment is completed in a a popup with Supertab checkout app. Supertab JS uses [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) for signaling payment status back to the parent window.

<Info>
  Since this method opens a popup, it should be called in response to a user action, e.g. a button click.
</Info>

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="checkoutUrl" type="string" required>
  The URL of the checkout page found in `actionRequiredDetails` object of the [`Supertab.api.purchase`](/supertab-js/reference/api#purchase) response.
</ParamField>


#### Returns

Boolean. `true` if the checkout was completed successfully, `false` otherwise (e.g. when the user closes the popup or cancels the payment).

#### Example

```typescript Make a purchase and get the checkout URL
const purchaseResponse = await supertabClient.api.purchase({
    offeringId: "test.offering-id"
});

const checkoutUrl = purchaseResponse.actionRequiredDetails.next;
```

```javascript Start the checkout process
<button onClick={
    () => supertabClient.checkout.start(checkoutUrl)
}>Pay</button>
```
