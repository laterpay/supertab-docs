Supertab JS provides a comprehensive low-level SDK. It can be used in pair with [experiences](/supertab-js/experiences/starting-experiences) or as a standalone library to build custom flows.

This low-level SDK does not feature any UI components and is focused on providing a way to consume Customer API responses directly while handling authentication and error management for you.

This reference guide documents clients available in the `Supertab` class (see [Installation](/supertab-js/installation)) and their methods. There are following client properties available:

- <a href="/supertab-js/reference/auth">auth</a> - Manages OAuth2 authentication
  flows and session data retrieval.
- <a href="/supertab-js/reference/api">api</a> - Facilitates direct access to Customer
  API endpoints.
- <a href="/supertab-js/reference/checkout">checkout</a> - Manages Supertab
  Checkout sessions for purchases requiring payment.
