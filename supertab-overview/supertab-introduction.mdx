title: Supertab Overview
description: 'Supertab is a novel digital payment solution, specifically designed to make small payments possible.'
---

For content and service providers, from GenAI to video to publishing, Supertab opens up a new revenue stream by monetizing users who would otherwise never subscribe. We enable users to unlock digital content without subscriptions, upfront payments, or long-term commitments - in other words, Supertab makes it easy to buy.

We do so by aggregating small charges on a running Tab and only processing them when a preset amount or time threshold is reached. This enables Supertab to minimize transaction fees and make processing small transactions more cost-effective.

We have options that can meet you whenever you are, whether you are looking for no-code, low-code, or custom solutions.
