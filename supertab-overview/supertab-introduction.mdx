title: Supertab Overview
description: 'Supertab is a novel form of digital payment, specifically designed to make small payments practical.'
---

While we can process larger amounts, our superpower is making small, previously impossible payment amounts possible.

We do so by aggregating small charges on a running Tab and only processing them when a present amount or time treshold is reached. Thanks to that, we can minimize transaction fees and make processing small transactions more cost-effective.

We build solutions that can meet you whenever you are, whether you are looking for no-code, low-code, or custom solutions.
