---

Sell any digital item or good for prices as low as $0.01. Supertab's payment aggregation system makes small purchases viable for the first time.

## Customers

Supertab provides a customer account and manages payment details, payments, invoicing and receipts, and fraud prevention. Customers can use their existing Supertab account when make purchases from you.

## The Tab

Purchases from many merchants are placed on a Tab, which aggregates purchases until reaching a predefined limit or inactivity period. Once this limit is reached the Tab closes and the customer is required to make payment.
By combining purchases from across the internet onto a customer's Tab, Supertab is able to offer transaction fees not possible with traditional payment processing.

### Limits and Inactivity

Established customers for which Supertab holds payment details have a default limit of $5 (or local equivalent).
Tabs reaching this limit must be paid. Customers expect to pay off their Tab once for every $5 of purchases they accumulate, or once per checkout for a purchases or purchases exceeding $5 total.

Where Supertab holds payment details for a customer we automatically close the Tab and take payment after an inactivity period. Customers making no further purchases within 14 days of opening their Tab will make payment at the end of the inactivity period.

## Checkout

Customers see a Supertab checkout confirmation screen for every purchase or bundle of purchases they make.
You may pass either a single purchase or list of purchases (shopping cart) for the customer to purchase using Supertab. Depending on their Tab limit the customer make not be required to make payment immediately â€“ this is to allow the customer to make further purchases and utilise the benefits of Supertab's payment aggregation system.

## Purchase Lifecycle

### Pending

Purchases begin in a `pending` state in which Supertab is either awaiting user approval to add the item to the customer's tab, or waiting for payment when a Tab limit has been crossed.

### Completed

Purchases are `completed` once the item has been successfully added to the customer's Tab, or when the Tab has been paid in the case of purchases which exceed the Tab limit.

Once a purchases is `completed` you should grant access to the good or service the customer is purchasing. Payment will be taken at a later date.

## Purchase Validation

Sell with confidence by receiving notification of completed purchases, querying our API for purchases status or utilising our frontend tools to make sure your pending purchases have completed.

## Payments

Customers must make payment after reaching their Tab limit or after a period of inactivity.
Where Supertab holds payment details for a customer we may take this payment automatically.
You will receive funds immediately after the customer has paid off their Tab.
