Setting up a new business account is quite straightforward and will take between 2 and 10 minutes depending on wether you choose to finish the KYC (Know Your Customer) process upfront or not.  

We want you to start building as quickly as possible, so KYC is not required upfront. As long as you don't finish it, all the experiences will only be available in Test Mode and you will not be able to process real transactions. 


## Creating a new Account:
1) Go to [https://business.supertab.co](https://business.supertab.co/register)
2) Create an account by direct email setup or social login. 
3) Verify your email address by clicking on the **Verify My Email** button and following the instructions.

At this point you can continue on to create your first site and offerings. All experiences you create will be in Test Mode, meaning you will not be able to process real transactions and receive payouts. However, you will be able to test your integration with us.

## Inviting teammates 
To manage or add new administrators to your account, use the Team section.

To add a new administrator to your account click Add User and enter their email address. They will receive an invitation email from Supertab to join this account. 
To resend this invitation select the ellipsis menu beside their name and select Generate Link. 
New users will be marked as Pending until they activate their account through their invitation. Then they will be marked as Active

Users can be removed at any time by clicking the ellipsis menu beside their name and selecting Remove User.

## KYC (Know Your Customer) and payment account setup
If you want to receive payouts, you need to confirm your identity and register your payment account with our provider, Stripe.
To finish this process, you will need to provide your business details and bank information (either your bank login or routing and account number). If your business is located in USA, Stripe will also need the last 4 digits od your SSN. 
1) Click on the **Finish setting up your account** button on one of the pop-ups you will see after setting up a site or creating an experience. 
2) Enter your country and confirm. You will be taken to Stripeâ€™s website to finish the process. (**CAUTION: once selected, your country cannot be changed**).
3) On the Stripe Landing page Enter your phone number and email address. Verify with the code you receive. 
4) Proceed with Stripe verification process. When asked, provide details of the bank account which we should use for payouts.

Once verified, you will be redirected back to the Business Portal.
 
## Payouts
Customer payments are processed immediately but can take up to three business days to appear in your bank account. You can track current payouts in real time on the Business Portal Dashboard.
