title: "New Purchase Flow and Tab auto-closing: better UX for users, improved fund collection and branding options for Merchants"
description: "All purchases now follow a single, modular flow designed to convert better, explain the Tab system clearly, and guarantee merchant payouts with early card collection and Tab auto-closing."

### What’s new

We’ve redesigned the entire purchase flow to work for all purchase scenarios. Whether you use out-of-the-box Experiences or build custom integrations, your users will go through a consistent, flexible purchase experience.

We are also delivering features meant to help Merchants secure more funds.

- Merchants can now select if users are required to have a card on file to make a purchase. It is controlled per Website. This feature is designed to simplify payments for repeat users, while also enabling Tab auto-closing.
- Tab auto-closing is enabled globally. If a user has a card on file and has at least \$1 on their Tab, we will charge their card after 30 days of inactivity.

### Why it matters

This new flow simplifies the user journey, improves transparency, and removes friction. It adapts to user type (new vs. returning), supports early card-on-file capture, explains dynamic Tab limits, and makes the Tab system easier to understand, so users complete more purchases.

Merchants can provide branded, cohesive experiences while having more control over card capture rules. Auto-closing helps unlock revenue that has previously been locked on open Tabs.

### How it works

**New purchase flow**

No action is required. If you use Basic Paygate or Supertab Button, the new purchase flow will inherit colors from their configuration. If you have a logo added to your Website settings, we will pull it into the flow automatically.

In the next release, we will deliver more granular controls for users of Supertab.JS

**Card capture**

While we normally save cards during payments, card capture allows us to collect card details from users who have not yet reached the Tab limit. When adding something to their Tab, they will be asked to provide card details to continue. It looks like this:

Card capture is disabled by default. If you would like to enable it, go to Websites, click the Edit button (pencil icon) next to the Website you would like to edit. You will find an option to enable or disable card capture at the bottom of Website details.

**Tab auto-closing**

No action required. We are enabling this for all users with a card on file.

If a user has at least \$1 (or equivalent in other currencies) on their Tab and they have not added anything to their Tab for 30 days, we will charge their card and close the Tab.

We’re excited to bring this all-in-one upgrade to life. Better flow. Better experience. More funds for Merchants.
