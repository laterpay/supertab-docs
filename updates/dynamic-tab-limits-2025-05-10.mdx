title: "Dynamic Tab Limits — Build Trust and Close Payments Faster"
description: "First-time users now get a smaller Tab to start, making it easier to complete a payment early and unlock the full $5 Tab. Faster conversions for Merchants, shorter time-to-value for users."
---

### **What’s new**

The first Tab opened for a user is now capped at \$1 (or €1). Once it’s paid off, users automatically unlock the standard \$5 limit.

### **Why it matters**

This helps users understand how the Tab works right away—and helps Merchants see more closed transactions sooner. With more users reaching the payment point on their first interaction, we improve collection rates, reduce friction, and build trust across the board.

We’re excited to make the Tab experience smoother and more rewarding for both users and Merchants. [Feedback welcome](mailto:product@supertab.co).
