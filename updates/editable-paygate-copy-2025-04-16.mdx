title: "Customize Your Paygate Messaging in Multiple Languages"
description: "Tailor your Paygate messaging to fit your use case, test what converts best, and speak to users in one of eight supported languages—including English (US & UK), Japanese, Spanish, French, and more."

### What’s new

Merchants can now edit two key Paygate text elements: the **title** and the **“More access options” button**. These fields can be customized per language, giving you greater control over how your offer is presented across different markets.

Why it matters

This update lets you adjust messaging to match your product and brand, while also giving you space to test different headlines and calls to action for better conversion. And with support for eight languages, you can localize copy for a global audience.

Available languages are:

- English (US & UK)
- French
- German
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Spanish
- Italian
- Japanese

### How it works

**![Experience editor - custom text](/images/experienceeditorcustomtext.png)

Adding custom text**

1. Head to the **Customization** tab in the Experience Editor.
2. You’ll find input fields for Paygate title and button text, along with a language selector and 60-character limit.
3. Add your custom text in selected languages, and save when you’re ready. You have to provide translations for all languages you need as we will not translate them automatically.

If you do not provide a custom text, we will use out default title ('Get Access In Seconds') and button ('More access options'), and their default translations.

Please note that the preview is currently only available in English.

**Removing custom text**

If you wish to remove custom text and go back to our defaults, simply remove custom text from the Experience Editor and save changes.

We’re excited to help you build messaging that fits your voice and drives results. Want to learn more or request features? [Contact us](mailto:sales@supertab.co).
