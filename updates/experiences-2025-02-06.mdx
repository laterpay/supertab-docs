Supertab supports selling access to your content for prices as low as 1Â¢, on a one-off or subscription basis.
Customers make purchases against a running tab which they settle after reaching a predefined limit.

The Paygate offers several key enhancements over the previous On Page Widget:

- Increased flexibility in the type and number of offerings sold.
  You are no longer restricted to selling exactly three offerings.
- Sell one-off timepasses or subscriptions side by side, improving your revenue pipeline and conversion from occassional to regular customers
- Link offerings together as upsells to make clear to customers which offerings are the best value for money.
- Customizable styling to match your identity.

Paygates are the first major component to Supertab Experiences, providing you with a variety of ways to monetize
your content in a way that works for your business.
