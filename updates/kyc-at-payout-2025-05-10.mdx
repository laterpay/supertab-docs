### **What’s new**

- **Google Ad Manager users** can now activate the Supertab integration without completing KYC.
- **All other users** can now use live mode—real transactions included—before completing KYC.

### **Why it matters**

This makes onboarding faster and smoother. New Merchants can launch in minutes, start earning immediately, and evaluate Supertab without friction. KYC only kicks in when you’re ready to get paid.

### **How it works**

You will be prompted to complete KYC whenever you log in, but it will only be required when it’s time to withdraw your balance.
