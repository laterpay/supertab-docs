### What’s new

We’re thrilled to introduce **Off-App Purchases**, a seamless, purchase flow that lets you bypass in-app purchases and retain full control of transactions.

### Why it matters

Following the recent court decision allowing developers to sell off-app without being forced into Apple’s in-app ecosystem, this update empowers you to offer your Supertab-powered experiences directly inside your app or site—keeping more revenue in your hands.

### How it works

**1. Generate a Purchase Link**
Simply append `client_id` (your site’s live or test ID) and `offering_id` to Supertab’s purchase endpoint:

```plaintext
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering
```

This creates a URL users can click or be redirected to for a streamlined purchase. See [our documentation](https://docs.supertab.co/supertab-integrate/off-app-purchases) for details.

**2. Add Optional Metadata**
Boost context and tracking with metadata: encode it as a URL string and pass it in your redirect for seamless handling:

```js
const metadata = { user_id: "123", nonce: "456", timestamp: Date.now() };
const encoded = encodeURIComponent(new URLSearchParams(metadata).toString());
const url = `https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=...&offering_id=...&metadata=${encoded}`;
```

On success, this data returns with the purchase object—making attribution and validation easier. See [our documentation](https://docs.supertab.co/supertab-integrate/off-app-purchases) for details.

**3. Handle the Redirect**
After purchase, the user is sent back to your app or site. You’ll receive clear parameters:

- `purchase_id` — a Supertab-generated identifier
- `status` — either `completed` or `abandoned`
- `offering_id` — the purchased item’s ID
- `metadata` — your custom information, if provided

### Your Next Steps

- **Set up or reuse your Supertab site** for purchase landing and redirect management.
- **Enable one or multiple offerings** you want to make available off-app.
- **Generate and integrate personalized links** within your app or web interface.
- **Test end-to-end redirects and metadata handling** to ensure the flow is intuitive and reliable.
