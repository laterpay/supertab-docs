### What’s new

You can now generate a seamless off-app purchase link that lets customers buy without being routed through in-app purchase systems. You own the transaction end-to-end.

### Why it matters

A recent court decision cleared the way for developers to sell off-app without being locked into Apple’s payment system. This update puts that power in your hands — letting you keep more revenue, stay in control of pricing, and deliver the same friction-free checkout you expect from Supertab.

### How it works

**1. Generate a Purchase Link**\
Append your client_id (live or test) and offering_id to Supertab’s purchase endpoint:

```plaintext
https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=client.your_client&offering_id=offering.your_offering
```

Users can click or be redirected to this link for a quick checkout.

**2. Add Optional Metadata**\
Pass extra context — like user_id, nonce, or timestamp — encoded into the URL. It returns with the purchase object, making attribution and validation simple.

```js
const metadata = { user_id: "123", nonce: "456", timestamp: Date.now() };
const encoded = encodeURIComponent(new URLSearchParams(metadata).toString());
const url = `https://purchase.supertab.co/?client_id=...&offering_id=...&metadata=${encoded}`;
```

**3. Handle the Redirect**\
After purchase, users are sent back to your website or app with:

- `purchase_id` — Supertab’s transaction ID
- `status` — `completed` or `abandoned`
- `offering_id` — your product ID
- `metadata` — any custom data you passed in

### Your Next Steps

- Set up or reuse your Supertab website for landing and redirect handling.
- Enable one or more offerings for off-app availability.
- Generate links and place them in your app or website flows.
- Test the redirect and metadata flow end-to-end.
