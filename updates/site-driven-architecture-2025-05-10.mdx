### **What’s new**

We’ve updated the platform’s information architecture to follow a Site-driven model. Merchants now work within a single Site at a time, with updated navigation, clearer table views, and improved field requirements across the platform.

Menu emphasizes the items that are most important during day-to-day Supertab management - Offerings and Experiences, while setup and less frequently used items are tucked away in sub-menus.

### **Why it matters**

This change makes it easier to manage multiple Sites and avoids confusion when navigating large sets of Offerings or Experiences. You’ll spend less time switching context and more time building and optimizing.

### **How it works**

Once you select a Site, everything from the sidebar to the Experience Editor adjusts to reflect that context. We’ve also updated table layouts and renamed key elements for clarity.

The organization submenu allows you to:

- switch between organizations,
- manage account users and settings,
- manage Sites,
- work with Webhooks and API keys,

while the profile submenu allows you to manage your profile, visit support and log out.

We’ll keep refining navigation as we grow—[let us know what you’d like to see next](mailto:product@supertab.co).
