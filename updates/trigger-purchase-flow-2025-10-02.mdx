### What’s new

The new createPurchase method in Supertab.js makes it simple for developers to programmatically trigger Supertab’s purchase flow directly inside their applications.

### Why it matters

Speed up and simplify custom integrations with a single function call, and tailor the purchase journey to your brand’s design.

This release continues our push to make Supertab more flexible and developer-friendly, while giving businesses the freedom to design experiences that fit their customers best.

### How it works

1.	Initialize Supertab.js in your app as usual.
2.	Call createPurchase with an offering_id.
3.	Handle the response to guide your user through the confirmation or next step.

The result: your users stay within your product experience, while leveraging Supertab’s purchase flow.
