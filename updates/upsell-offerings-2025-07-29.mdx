### What’s new

You can now set an upsell offering as the **default selection** on your paywall.

### Why it matters

Most users stick with the option that’s pre-selected. By making an upsell the default, you can nudge customers toward higher-value plans without adding clicks or friction. It’s a low-lift way to boost ARPU while still giving users freedom of choice.

### How it works

When configuring your paywall offerings, choose which plan should appear as the default selection. This can be:

- A longer time pass
- A subscription  
- A bundled package  
- Any upsell you want to feature  

The default appears pre-selected when the paywall loads, but users can switch to another option at any time.
