title: "Validate Purchases with Server-Side Webhooks"
description: "Merchants can now securely confirm completed purchases and trigger powerful post-purchase workflows—like granting access, sending emails, or updating analytics—in real time."

### What’s new

We’ve introduced two key features to help merchants validate purchases securely:

1. Webhooks that notify your server when a purchase is complete
2. Enhanced client-side callbacks that include detailed purchase data

### Why it matters

For high-value services—like generative AI or premium content—client-side validation isn’t enough. This release enables secure, server-side confirmation of purchases before access is granted, reducing fraud and protecting merchant resources.

### What you can do with it

Server-side webhooks unlock a wide range of automation and security options:

- **Secure Access Control** — Grant access to content or services only after a verified purchase.
- **Personalized Onboarding** — Kick off welcome emails, setup flows, or user provisioning.
- **Real-Time Analytics** — Sync purchase data with internal dashboards or CRMs.
- **Customer Support Workflows** — Create support tickets or alerts when purchases happen.
- **Loyalty & Rewards** — Automatically assign points or trigger reward logic based on purchases.

### How it works

- Enable webhooks from the new **Webhooks** tab in the Business Portal. We use Svix to deliver events like purchase.added, including key purchase metadata.
- Use the updated `onPurchaseComplete` callback in Tab.js to access purchase ID, user ID, and other validation data.
- Webhooks also work in [**Test Mode**](https://docs.supertab.co/supertab-experiences/test-mode), so you can safely build and test your integration.

This gives you end-to-end purchase security and the flexibility to build powerful merchant-side workflows. Want to see it in action? [Reach out for a demo or setup support](mailto:sales@supertab.co).
